# Short bio or description (displayed in the header)
description: As a Data Scientist I conduct hypothesis testing, generate forecasts, automate data flows, and develop client-facing analytics products. I have a personal focus on applying Bayesian philosophies to business solutions and using machine learning to assist in media optimization.
   
Prior to the move to IMM, I was a Research Associate at BBC Research & Consulting where I worked on disparity study research. I have published an economic study on the effects of commodity shocks on maritime piracy. I received my BA in business economics from Seattle University and my MA in Economics from University of Colorado â€“ Denver.
